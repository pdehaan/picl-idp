This directory contains some very simple loadtests, written using
the "loads" framework:

    https://github.com/mozilla/loads


To run them, do the following:

  $> make build     # installs local environment with all dependencies
  $> make test      # runs a single test, to check that everything's working
  $> make bench     # runs a much longer higher-concurrency test.
